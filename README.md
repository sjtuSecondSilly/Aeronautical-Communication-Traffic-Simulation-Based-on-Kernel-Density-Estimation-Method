-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks have been emerging as a revolutionary solution for ubiquitous communication in the upcoming sixth generation (6G) wireless communication network. Efficient resource allocation in these satellite networks requires precise analysis of communication traffic demand. To simulate an accurate representation of the spatial-temporal communication traffic pattern worldwide, this paper utilizes Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to simulate aircraft positions and employs a time-varying communication intensity model. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through numerical simulation results.
